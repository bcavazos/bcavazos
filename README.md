## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an early career ecologist and educator interested in phenotypic plasticity, mutualistic interactions, rapid environmental change, and plant-animal interactions. I teach various undergraduate courses in biology and am passionate about increasing data literacy in STEM courses and decolonizing curriculum.
